# Building Video Summarizer Using AI

![blog-cover](images/cover.webp)

With the recent advancements in AI technology, such as OpenAI, it has become possible to automate tasks that were previously too tedious to perform manually. An example of this is a video summarizer. Previously, the process of summarizing video content relied mainly on human vision and hearing. However, with AI models such as [GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4) and [Whisper](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/whisper), it is now possible to automate this task.

We will be utilizing the following technologies: OpenAI, Node.js, React, and GridDB. This blog will teach you how to create a basic web application for uploading a video and receiving a summary of the content.

## Getting Started

These are the mandatory requirements that you need to run this project:

1. OpenAI Key

To access any OpenAI services, you need a valid key. Go to this [link](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create a new OpenAI key.

> The OpenAI key is on a project basis, so you need to create a project first in the OpenAI platform.

### Node.js

### React.js

### GridDB

## Run the Project
